# AdventOfElixir2024

**Solution to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) event written in Elixir.**

No guarantee for correctness or completeness.

To use this with your own input, add the input as a .txt file in the folder of the day in the format ``1_1_test_input.txt`` for the first part of the day 1 exercise, if you want to check against the example input
or ``1_1_input.txt`` to solve the actual exercise. If the input for part 1 and 2 are identical, save them as ``1_test_input.txt`` or ``1_input.txt`` respectively. 

For Each part exercise ``test()`` loads the test input and solves it, the same for ``prod()`` for the actual excercise.

Exercise descriptions and inputs are not bundled in the repo, as per instructions by the Advent of Code maintainer

To create a new folder for day x, you can run ``./aoc_gen ``. Replace x with the da you want to create a folder for, for example ``24``. This command automatically creates empty imput files and skeletons for each part.
